# Hook ID

👨‍💼 Based on what's happening now, I think we're not isolating the `state`
between the two hooks. We need to uniquely identify each hook and store their
state separately.

We know that the hooks are called in the same order every time, so we could keep
a call index (we'll call it the `hookIndex`) and increment it every time
`useState` is called. That way, we could assign the first hook an ID of `0` and
the second hook an ID of `1`.

Then we store the `state` and `setState` in an array with their ID as the
key.

Then, whenever we render we just reset the `hookIndex` to `0` and we'll be
golden!
