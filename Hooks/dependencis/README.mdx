# Dependencies

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/tutorials/build-react-hooks/requirements-for-the-dependency-array" />

🧝‍♂️ I've updated the `useEffect`:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
	if (enabled) {
		console.info('consider yourself effective!')
	} else {
		console.info('consider yourself ineffective!')
	}
}, [enabled])
```

You can <PrevDiffLink>check my work</PrevDiffLink> if you'd like. The app's not
technically broken, but the logs should only happen when toggling enabled and
right now we're getting logs when clicking the counter as well.

👨‍💼 We can handle this! So you'll need to also keep track of the deps array and
even the previous value of the deps array. Then just add a little logic to
determine whether to call the effect callback based on whether any of the
dependencies changed.

You can do this. Let's go!
